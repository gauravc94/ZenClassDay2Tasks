Difference between Document object and Window object
-----------------------------------------------------
The Window and Document objects in web development may appear similar, causing confusion.
Understanding the Browser Object Model (BOM) and Document Object Model (DOM) clarifies this.


Browser Object Model:

The BOM contains objects that represent the current browser window or tab, with properties such as browser history and location.
Window Object is the topmost object and outermost element in the object hierarchy.
In a multi-tab browser, a window object represents a single tab, but certain properties like innerHeight and methods like resizeTo() affect the entire browser window.

Window object facilitates the use of timers (setTimeout, setInterval) and event handling.
Developers can schedule tasks or respond to user interactions using these features.

// Example: Setting a timeout to execute a function after 3 seconds
setTimeout(function() {
  alert('Delayed alert!');
}, 3000);


Document Object Model:

The DOM is created by the browser when a web page loads.
The document object represents the HTML document as a tree of objects (HTML, HEAD, BODY, and other tags).
The document object is the root element that signifies the HTML document.

The Document object is primarily used for DOM manipulation.
Developers can access and modify the content, structure, and styles of an HTML document using methods and properties provided by the Document object.

// Example: Changing the text content of an element with id 'exampleElement'
document.getElementById('exampleElement').textContent = 'New Text';


NOTE:

Both window and document objects have properties and methods.
Some method names are the same but behave differently.
For example, window.open() opens a new tab or window, while document.open() creates a blank document within the window.

We can access the document object using window.document property or directly as document since window is a global object.


Conclusion:

The window object represents a window/tab containing a DOM document, while the document object is a property of the window object pointing to the loaded DOM document.

The Document and Window objects are integral to JavaScript in the browser and they serve distinct purposes.
The Document object focuses on interacting with the content and structure of the HTML document through the DOM, while the Window object provides a global interface for managing the browser environment.
Both these objects enable the developers to create engaging, dynamic web experiences.
